# Scikit-Optimize: Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization
 Scikit Optimize implements several methods for sequential model-based optimization.  The library is very easy to use and provides a general toolkit for Bayesian optimization that can be used for hyperparameter tuning. It also provides support for tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms offered by the scikit-learn library.
